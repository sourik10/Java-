What is Interface ? An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. 
  1.It is used to achieve abstraction.
  2.By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
  3.It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

What is Class ?
A class is a user-defined data type. It is a blueprint or template which is used for creating objects. Each object has some properties and methods. 
A class encapsulates the data and behavior of an object into a single entity. This property makes a class easy to use and maintain.
